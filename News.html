        <h1><a>1. The 70s are back in 2021 — but not in the way you think</a></h1><br><br><br><br>
        <p>America's withdrawal from Afghanistan has naturally drawn comparisons to its military failure in Vietnam. And every mention of inflation has some people warning that we're on the verge of the 1970s economy, too. Yet these aren't the only things reminding Americans of the 1970s in 2021. Our culture is also conjuring up these memories for some.</p>
        <p>If the disco era is most noted for American narcissism, this summer's zeitgeist struck a familiar note, with “The White Lotus” reveling in the self-absorption of the 1 percent. HBO's general roster, from the “Gossip Girl” reboot to “The Undoing” and “Succession,” mines wealthy New Yorkers whose indulgence drives story lines.</p>

        <h1><a>2. How the 70s Dethroned the 60s as Popular Music's Golden Age</a></h1><br><br><br><br>
        <p>Without us quite noticing, the 70s have carved out as exalted a place in the pop-music canon as the 60s. And in many ways, their wide-ranging masterpieces—from punk and disco to proto hip-hop and heavy metal—speak more powerfully to the present than the highlights of any other decade in the 20th century.</p>
        <p>What was the single greatest year in rock history? As with most critical thought experiments, this is a question with no right answer, but one that's fun and useful to argue about anyway. The way we respond to it probably says more about music's present than its past. Do we revisit the primordial ooze of 1951, when Ike Turner's Kings of Rhythm recorded “Rocket 88,” a top contender for first rock and roll song? What about 1956 or 1964, when Elvis' and then the Beatles' Ed Sullivan performances heralded successive tidal waves of youth culture? Or 1969, when that culture coalesced at Woodstock, a generation-defining event of the boomers' own making?</p>

        <h1><a>3. A SONG IS NOT A SANDWICH: WHY 70S MUSIC STILL RULES</a></h1><br><br><br><br>
        <p>I gig a lot. And when I say a lot, I mean that through the summer and fall just my weekends often entail at least three shows if not more. The dead of winter might have me down to two shows a week, but often at least one of those shows has me playing and singing for three or more hours. I've learned a lot of music, I've written a lot of music, and I've observed the response of a live audience to all sorts of genres and decades of music. I can tell you that “I Will Survive” is always a showstopper. If you play “Man, I Feel Like A Woman,” most women in the room scream, grab for another female hand, and dance their way in front of the band, fulfilling their “prerogative to have a little fun.” “Play That Funky Music White Boy” gets requested way more than you think, and “Billie Jean” usually ends up with a large group of folks in a circle daring each other to dance to the middle and show off their moves.  I've gotten requests for Third Eye Blind and John Prine, Dolly Parton and Fleetwood Mac. From Millennials to Baby Boomers, I hear the same requests from the same eras.</p>
        <p>I think it's more interesting what I'm not hearing.I almost never hear a request for anything happening right now. To be fair, I did have the one guy ask me to play Drake at my solo acoustic guitar gig. I had to politely decline. Just didn't make sense. And true, people are quite happy to dance to “Wagon Wheel.” But what people may not know about that tune is the chorus was first recorded in 1973. Bob Dylan first wrote it and then additions were made by Old Crow Medicine Show to create the modern version. Once again, this dance floor winner didn't start out in the modern era. Wherever I go, for some reason people would much rather hear Stevie Wonder than One Republic. They choose “Ring of Fire” over “Body Like a Back Road,” and “Friends in Low Places” is still the best “send 'em on home” song out there.  Why is it that when we play Katy Perry, a few folks gratuitously continue dancing, hoping the next song is maybe “Kiss” by Prince or “Don't Stop Believing”? (Yes, still a highly requested little number despite the cliché.) Why don't people request the tunes that are on the radio right now?</p>

        <h1><a>4. Fellowship will fund study of Warhol's impact on 70s music</a></h1><br><br><br><br>
        <p>Judith Peraino, professor of music in the College of Arts and Sciences, won a 12-month fellowship from the National Endowment for the Humanities to research artist Andy Warhol's influence on pop and rock musicians in the 1970s. Peraino's proposed book, “Popism in Stereo: A Musical Guide to the Warhol Seventies,” will be the first dedicated study of Andy Warhol and popular music based substantially on archival research and new interviews.</p>
        <p>Chapters focus on musicians within rock (the Beatles, Mick Jagger, David Bowie and Lou Reed); punk (New York Dolls, Blondie and Talking Heads), disco (Grace Jones) and hip hop (Fab Five Freddie).These musicians' careers bore the imprint of Warhol's influence, Peraino said, and, in turn, left traces in Warhol's art and archive.“When we think of Warhol and rock musicians, the first thing that comes to most peoples' minds is his association with the Velvet Underground in the late 1960s, and the 1960s tends to dominate how we think about Warhol and his artistic and social revolution,” Peraino said. “No scholars or journalists have taken a thorough look at what Warhol's aesthetic and persona meant to pop and rock music in the next decade when his influence seemed to be even greater.”</p>

        <h1><a>5. Music Played in the 1970's Popular Music From the 70s</a></h1><br><br><br><br>
        <p>The 1970s created a perfect musical bridge from the rebelliousness of the 1960s and the happy songs that are characteristic of the 1980s. Following the counterculture of the 60s, the and the 70s created a trend of relaxing music as well as dance music. People may have grown tired of the fighting that happened the previous decade and many of them sought a refuge in dance clubs and other places to enjoy a good time. Out of this idea emerged the Disco movement. Of course, there were still the bands and artists that continued to speak of the ills of society, typically characterized by the punk music in the latter part of the decade. Although the rebellious idea had died down shortly following Woodstock in 1969, there were still many people that disagreed with the establishment and the way the country was being run. Most people, though, were just looking for another way to vent their frustrations, which helped to give rise to the fun that disco music provided. The 1970's was not a unique decade in terms of creating innovations in musical styles and genres, but it was unique in that it was a musical bridge connecting the hippie lifestyle of the 1960s with the characteristic yuppie lifestyle that was about to occur in the 1980s.</p>

        <h1><a>6. David Bowie Influenced More Musical Genres Than Any Other Rock Star</a></h1><br><br><br><br>
        <p>Justly celebrated for blurring genres and opening minds around the globe, the late David Bowie's influence across the spectrum of Western music is formidable. Actually, it's more than formidable. While many late rock stars are rightly saluted for their influence and impact, Bowie occupies a higher historical tier entirely. He's not just an influential rocker. He's not merely one of the most influential rockers. Among rock stars, Bowie influenced more musical genres than anyone else, living or dead. He is, in that respect, the most influential rock star.</p>
        <p>Let's run through this. Obviously, no one is going to question how essential he was to glam rock. While The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars and Aladdin Sane ensured his long-term career and infamy, glam rock as a genre owes him just as much. If Bowie hadn't gone glam, history would remember it as a goofy, cute curiosity — a sub-genre full of wacky fashion and frothy pop songs, but producing no serious content (apart from one or two T. Rex albums, depending on your taste). Most glam rockers are remembered as that — glam rockers. Bowie, however, produced two albums squarely within the style while simultaneously transcending it. The aforementioned titles aren't simply glam classics — they're rock classics. They're singer-songwriter classics. They are, simply put, works of art.</p>

        <h1><a>7. 1970s Music: History, Pictures & Artists</a></h1><br><br><br><br>
        <p>Enormous music festivals like Woodstock disappeared as quickly as they arrived, due to the inherent danger of attending. Riots, drugs, and violent crowds caused many potentially legendary festivals to be cancelled. Among the popular artists in 1970 year were Elton John, who arrived from England and the Jackson Five, hailing from “Motown” AKA Detroit, Michigan. Ranging from 12-19 years old, the Jackson 5, featuring 12-year-old Michael Jackson, captured imaginations across the country. Diana Ross left the Supremes for solo fame. Neil Diamond, hit it big with “Cracklin' Rosie” while Simon and Garfunkel impressed audiences with “Bridge Over Troubled Waters.”</p>
        <p>Johnny Cash won two Grammy awards for his song, “A Boy Named Sue.” Hard-rock group Three Dog Night ranked high on the national best-seller list. Elvis reappeared in concert, after making nearly 30 movies in the 1960s. Burt Bacharach gained new popularity with songs for TV and concerts.

            1970 marked the end of an era. The Beatles dissolved, suffering internal conflicts. Each went their separate ways appearing on solo albums. Arguably the world's most famous group of all time was no more. The pop and rock music world, which The Beatles had forever changed, would never be the same.
            
            Louis Armstrong recovered from illness to throw a famous birthday bash on his “70th birthday” on July 4, 1970. It wasn't known until the 1980s that his true birthday was on August 4, 1901. When he died in 1971, he was actually only 69 years old.
            
            A statue was planned to be erected in Armstrong's birthplace of New Orleans. Incredible jazz-only festivals were staged in Monterey and Newport.</p>
